This is a React Native app using expo, created with 'npx create-expo-app' and runs with 'npx expo start'. The Stock App allows users to enter information about a stock such as the stock symbol, share price, and number of shares.
This information is stored in a database and displayed on a second page. The second page is intended to act as a hub to update and view previous investments. Although much more could be done in idea and execution, the Stock
App serves as an entry level demonstration of React Native (using expo). 

This is a school project.
